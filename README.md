What does Anthem_AutoPress.ahk do?

Toggle F1 (On/Off): Salvage one Purple(Epic) or Blue(Rare) item at a time
    
    - Salvaging (Holding F key) doesn't last longer than 600ms, so it won't salvage your Masterwork or Legendary items
    
Toggle F2 (On/Off): Salvage like a Flexxi beast

    - This will try and salvage everything like how everyone does it by using the arrow keys and spamming the F key
    - WARNING: EVERYTHING WILL GET SALVAGED
    
Toggle F3 (On/Off) Create highlighted consumable over and over and over...

    - This will keep creating the same consumable over and over until you toggle F3 again.
